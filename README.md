<h1>Word Wide Web - A service for writers</h1>
<h2>About the project</h2>
<p>Word Wide Web is an app, that allows writers to publish their wokrs (all kinds of literature: novels, poems, dramas etc.) and allows users to read them and rate them on a scale from 1 to 10. In future there is also plan to allow users to create lists of works, or marking as their favourites.</p>
