<h1>Word Wide Web - A service for writers</h1>
<h2>About the project</h2>
<p>Word Wide Web is an app, that allows writers to publish their wokrs (all kinds of literature: novels, poems, dramas etc.) and allows users to read them and rate them on a scale from 1 to 10. In future there is also plan to allow users to create lists of works, or marking as their favourites. Project's yet unfinished, but we're working on it</p>
<h2>What we're currently working on</h2>
<h3>Author account</h3>
<p>Each user can create an author account, witch allows him to publish his works. They can publish whatever literature they want. They can publish either under their real names, or pseudonyms</p>
<h3>Works</h3>
<p>Works can be publish, but have to be accepted by moderators due to the risk of breaking the law, or future service terms. Author can add a description, cover photo and a pdf file with the work itself. After publishing author's also allowed to add translations to it's work</p>
<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>Each user can rate every work in a scale 1 to 10. There is also an algorhythm that measuring average notes and number of notes can create automatic charts (wage of those to element can be changed by user)</p>
<h3>Reviews</h3>
<p>Every user can write a review of each work, where they can express their opinion with something more, than one note on a scale 1 to 10. Every user can also comment their reviews</p>
<h2>Future plans</h2>
<h3>Lists</h3>
<p>Every user can create lists of works to help them create their own colletction of works they found on this service.</p>
<h3>Categories</h3>
<p>Each work can be considered as work of different categories (like for example comedy, horror etc.)</p>
